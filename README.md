# Java Multi-Client Server - Financial Services

This Java project involves creating a server that can handle multiple clients. The server provides financial services, including tax calculations, insurance calculations, bonus calculations, and net salary calculations.

## Services

- Tax Calculation
- Insurance Calculation
- Bonus Calculation
- Net Salary Calculation

The server is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously through the use of the `ClientHandler` class implementing the `Runnable` interface. Clients can connect to the server, choose a financial service from the provided menu, and receive the corresponding calculations.
